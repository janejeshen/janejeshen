### Hi there 👋

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented data professional with a strong focus on data analysis, business intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I thrive on transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decisions and real-world impact. Whether it’s building interactive dashboards, training predictive models, or uncovering trends through exploratory analysis—I'm all about solving problems with data.

🔍 What I enjoy most:
- Analyzing messy datasets and finding the story behind the numbers  
- Creating intuitive dashboards that highlight key business metrics  
- Designing machine learning models that automate and optimize decisions  
- Turning data science into real solutions that matter  

I’m always exploring new ways to bridge the gap between data and action—through thoughtful analysis, clean code, and effective communication.
